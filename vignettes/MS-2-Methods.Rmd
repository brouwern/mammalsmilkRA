The original methods-related assignment stated:

"Identify the statistical model(s) (aka statistical test) or approach you think will be most useful answering your question. Indicate wether you think your data will likely have to be transformed or if other issues will need to be accounted for such as blocking.  Revise your previous methods section describing the experiment and data to update anything else you know & add an outline of the steps invovled in your statistical analysis."
