"Display the key result of your study as a figure using R. Write a caption for it."

The figure should be made in R but additional annotations can be made in another program (eg pptx); the final image can be in standard file format (pptx, docx, jpeg etc.)  pptx and docx are ideal for being able to include a caption.
