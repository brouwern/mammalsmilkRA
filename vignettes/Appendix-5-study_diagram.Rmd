## Introduction

A diagram is often very useful for showing where a study took place, how an experiment was designed, how treatments were allocated, or how there are **dependencies** in the data.  Zuur & Ieno (2016) emphasize this ("Step 2: Visualize the experimental design" and "Step 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data"; see Figure 4).

What follows are references to different types of diagrams that you could include in your study.

Below is also an example using a graph of the hierarchical phylogenetic relationships.  

### Site maps: Where a study took place

These papers have examples of site maps for ecological studies; both maps are in the supplemental information.  The focus in more on providing contextual geographic information than the details of the study.

### Experimental layout maps

Ecological studies sometimes include maps to show the geometric arrangement of study plots or experimental treatments.

### Dependency structure diagrams

For complex experiments it can be useful to create a diagram that illustrate the hierarchical structure of the data, such as students in class rooms in schools in school districts in counties in states.

### Graphical abstracts

Graphical abstracts are becoming increasingly common in some fields.

### Flow charts


#### Clinical trials

Clinical trials often have a flow chart showing how an initial patient population was screen and then allocated to the experimental groups.

https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=PMC2945952_1471-2474-11-205-2&req=4

#### Meta-analyses

Meta-analyses often have flow charts showing how an initial pool of studies was screen for inclusion in the analysis.  The [PRISMA guidlines](http://prisma-statement.org/) (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses) recommend a 4-phase flow diagram be included in meta-analyses to describe the process of finding, screening, and extracting data from papers in a meta analysis.  See [Libarati et al 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100)

I've copied an example using You'll need to install the package if you want to make it yourself  eg run install.packages("PRISMAstatement").  See the [PRISMAstatement package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PRISMAstatement/vignettes/PRISMA.html for detaqils) for details

```{r}
library(PRISMAstatement)
prisma(found = 750,
       found_other = 123,
       no_dupes = 776, 
       screened = 776, 
       screen_exclusions = 13, 
       full_text = 763,
       full_text_exclusions = 17, 
       qualitative = 746, 
       quantitative = 319,
       width = 300, height = 300)
```

### Coordinated experiments across labs

The paper below has an interesting flow chart about how samples were shared across three labs to test for biases in lab techniques.  The ends result was a retraction of a [Cell paper!](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/12/27/harvard-biologist-retracts-diabetes-breakthrough-cell/)

### Dependency structure due to phylogeny

The dependency structure in the mammals milk data is due to phylogeny.  The original paper presents a phylogenetic tree as a figure.  Similarly,  code below is a first attempt to visualize this based on nominal taxonomic categories (class, order, family, genus, species).  Its not very clean yet.  


### Conceptual issues of clustering

The following papers discuss conceptual issues of grouping, clustering etc, but don't have pictures of it.

## Visualizing the structure of the mammals milk data


What follows is a code dump to make a diagram of the mammals milk data set.  Its not very clean yet; scroll down a ways to the bottom to see the output.

### Preliminaries

#### Load packages

```{r}
library(data.tree)
library(treemap)
library(here)
library(stringr)

```

#### Load data

#### Load data in R

This is particular to my computer 

```{r}
file. <- "Appendix-2-Analysis-Data_mammalsmilkRA.csv"
path. <- here("/inst/extdata",file.)

milk <- read.csv(path., skip = 3)


milk$ord <- gsub("11","",milk$ord)
```


#### Cleaning

```{r}
genus_spp_subspp_mat <- milk$spp %>% 
         str_split_fixed(" ", n = 3)

milk$genus <- genus_spp_subspp_mat[,1]

```

#### Set up taxonomy 

##### Class, subclass
```{r}
## class - all mammals
milk$class <- "Mammalia"

## Subclass

### everyone but Monotrmes are Theriiformes
#### = Yinotheria
milk$subclass <- "Theriiformes"
milk$subclass[which(milk$ord == "Monotremata")] <- "Yinotheria"
```


##### Cohort 
```{r}
milk$cohort <- "Placentalia"


Marsupialia <- c("Diprotodontia"  #marsupials
                      ,"Didelphimorphia" #opossums
                      ,"Dasyuromorphia"#tasmanian devil)
                      ,"Peramelemorphia" #bandicoots
                  )

milk$cohort[which(milk$ord %in% Marsupialia)] <- "Marsupialia"


milk$cohort[which(milk$ord == "Monotremata")] <- "Australosphenida"


```

##### magnorder
```{r}
milk$magnorder <- "Xenarthra-or-Epitheria"

milk$magnorder[which(milk$ord == "Monotremata")] <- "Monotremata-magnorder"

 Australidelphia <- c("Diprotodontia"  #marsupials
                      #,"Didelphimorphia" #opossums
                      ,"Dasyuromorphia"#tasmanian devil)
                      ,"Peramelemorphia" #bandicoots
                  )



milk$magnorder[which(milk$ord %in% Australidelphia)] <- "Australidelphia"

milk$magnorder[which(milk$ord == "Didelphimorphia")] <- "Ameridelphia"
```


### Use tables to look at dependencies

```{r}
with(milk,
     table(class, subclass))
```


```{r, echo = F}
with(milk,
     table(subclass, cohort))
with(milk,
     table(cohort, magnorder))
with(milk,
     table(ord, magnorder))
```


### Make hierachical graph

### Set up path string

```{r}
#milk$i <- 1:nrow(milk)
milk$pathString <- with(milk,
                        paste(class,  #Mammalia
                              subclass,
                              cohort,
                              magnorder,
                              ord,
                              sep = "/"))
```


#### Set up nodes

```{r}
milk_tree <- as.Node(milk)
```

#### Print hiearchy as text
```{r}
print(milk_tree, limit = 20)
```

#### Plot

Plot branch diagram
```{r}
plot(milk_tree)
```


Plot dendrogram
```{r}
plot(as.dendrogram(milk_tree),
     horiz = T,
     center = T, 
     cex = 0.5,
     nodePar = 1)
```
