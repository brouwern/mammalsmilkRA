# mammalsmilkRA

The goal of mammalsmilkRA is to demonstate what the key parts of an analysis compendium for a paper or class project might look like and provide tutorials for how to carry out the relevant tasks.

## Installation

Must have the devtools package.  You can download if needed using install.packages("devtools").

Note that mammalsmilkRA requires a lot of other packages (has a lot of "dependencies" in R lingo) so you might be prompted to download or update other things, and it might take a little bit of time for R to work through all the download.  Don't be alarmed by any red text.

``` r
devtools::install_github("brouwern/mammalsmilkRA")

library("mammalsmilkRA")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
